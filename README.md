## How does it work?

This custom workspace runs both Postgres and Apache with [Adminer](https://www.adminer.org/) already
downloaded and accessible on port 8008.

Once the workspace is up and running, just click on the available ports and open 8008 as preview or in a custom tab.

## How to login?

In order to login to the database select "postgres" and use:

| property | Â value            |
| -------- | ----------------- |
| system   | Â postgres         |
| server   | Â *don't touch it* |
| username | Â gitpod           |
| password | Â gitpod           |
| database | Â postgres         |

ðŸ‘‰ Choose the **permanent login** option so next
time you run the workspace, you'll be able to login with just one click.
